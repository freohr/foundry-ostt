# Old-School Treasure Tables

A module for Foundry VTT.

This module adds a new type of RollTable that behaves the way old-school versions of D&D (be it the 3 LBB of Original D&D, Basic/Expert, Advanced 1st and 2nd Editions and the BECMI line) define treasure tables: Each line in the table has a %-chance of being drawn for the total treasure, and the Referee rolls a separate d% for each line.
